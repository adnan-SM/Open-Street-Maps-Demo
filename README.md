Open-Street-Maps-Demo
=====================

A simple demo to demonstrate Open Street Maps

Update : Fixed the problem where the map wasn't being displayed

This project is a simple demonstartion of getting started with Open Street Maps. Open Street maps is a open source alternative to Google Maps. This project is intended to help beginners & removes the troubles of finding sample code online. When I was building this I faced quite a lot of issues and Documentation was kinda sparse, so I have decided to share with the community my findings.
